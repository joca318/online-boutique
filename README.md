**Online Boutique** is a cloud-native microservices demo application.
Online Boutique consists of a 10-tier microservices application. The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items,
add them to the cart, and purchase them.

**Google uses this application to demonstrate use of technologies like
Kubernetes/GKE, Istio, Stackdriver, gRPC and OpenCensus**. This application
works on any Kubernetes cluster, as well as Google
Kubernetes Engine. Itâ€™s **easy to deploy with little to no configuration**.

If youâ€™re using this demo, please **â˜…Star** this repository to show your interest!

> ðŸ‘“**Note to Googlers:** Please fill out the form at
> [go/microservices-demo](http://go/microservices-demo) if you are using this
> application.

## Quickstart (GKE)

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.svg)](https://ssh.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/editor?cloudshell_git_repo=https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo&cloudshell_workspace=.&cloudshell_tutorial=docs/cloudshell-tutorial.md)

1. **[Create a Google Cloud Platform project](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project)** or use an existing project. Set the `PROJECT_ID` environment variable and ensure the Google Kubernetes Engine and Cloud Operations APIs are enabled.

```
the clusters are created already
```

2. **Clone this repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/joca318/online-boutique.git 
cd online-boutique
```

3. **Access GKE cluster ASM0[1-2]**

```
_ZONE_1=us-central1-c
_CLUSTER_1=asm01
_PROJECT_ID_1=service-project-256014
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone=$_ZONE_1 $_CLUSTER_1 --project $_PROJECT_ID_1
```

```
_ZONE_2=us-east1-c
_CLUSTER_2=asm02
_PROJECT_ID_2=d-iot-gpa01
ZONE=us-east1-c
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --zone=$_ZONE_2 $_CLUSTER_2 --project $_PROJECT_ID_2
```

4. **Deploy the sample app to the clusters [ASM0[1-2]**

```
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-kubectl-testbinauthz.yaml --substitutions=_ZONE_2=us-east1-c,_PROJECT_ID_2=d-iot-gpa01,_CLUSTER_2=asm02,_ZONE_1=us-central1-c,_PROJECT_ID_1=service-project-256014,_CLUSTER_1=asm01,_PROJECT_ID=service-project-256014,_SEVERITY=HIGH
```

**The binauthz uses the SEVERITY to Deploy the sample app to the clusters. [ASM0[1-2]. If the Severity is set to LOW, the binautz will block the deploy and show an error message:**
```
Starting Step #1 - "severity check"
Step #1 - "severity check": Already have image (with digest): gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk
Step #1 - "severity check": Failed vulnerability check
Finished Step #1 - "severity check"
ERROR
ERROR: build step 1 "gcr.io/google.com/cloudsdktool/cloud-sdk" failed: step exited with non-zero status: 1
```

```
gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild-kubectl-testbinauthz.yaml --substitutions=_ZONE_2=us-east1-c,_PROJECT_ID_2=d-iot-gpa01,_CLUSTER_2=asm02,_ZONE_1=us-central1-c,_PROJECT_ID_1=service-project-256014,_CLUSTER_1=asm01,_PROJECT_ID=service-project-256014,_SEVERITY=LOW
```
5. **Wait for the Pods to be ready.**

```
kubectl get pods
```

After a few minutes, you should see:

```
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

shippingservice-6ccc89f8fd-v686r         2/2     Running   0          2m58s
```

7. **Access the web frontend in a browser** using the frontend's `EXTERNAL_IP`.

```
kubectl get svc -n frontend -l istio=ingressgateway'
```

*Example output - do not copy*

```
EXTERNAL-IP
<your-ip>
```

**Note**- you may see `<pending>` while GCP provisions the load balancer. If this happens, wait a few minutes and re-run the command.

8. [Optional] **Clean up**:

```
skaffold delete -f skaffold-modules-deploy.yaml  --kube-context=asm01
skaffold delete -f skaffold-modules-deploy.yaml  --kube-context=asm02
```

## Other Deployment Options 
**to deploy using Cloud Deploy.** we can execute the script deploy.sh. This one will create a simple pipeline with 2 targets


## Architecture.

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC. See the [Development Principles](/docs/development-principles.md) doc for more information.
